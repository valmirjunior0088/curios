# Curios

Curios is an interpreter (and hopefully, in the future, a compiler) for a work-in-progress dependently typed functional programming language. The project is still very young, there is only an abstract syntax tree and a parser for it, but progress, albeit slow, is steady.

In the [test file](https://github.com/valmirjunior0088/curios/blob/master/test/Spec.hs) there is an example of what the source code looks like along with the abstract syntax tree that represents it. The project's first objective is to be able to typecheck F-Algebras and F-Coalgebras.

Feel free to throw suggestions my way! Anything helps, really. There's a lot that still needs to be learned in order for this project to grow, and I love any and all discussions about type theory.

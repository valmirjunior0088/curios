//! Structural acceptance fixtures. Each test compiles a small `.crs` fixture to the raw, pre-Binaryen wasm module and asserts a structural property of the emitted code — a clean natural loop for a hot kernel, direct recursion, the closure ABI only where a call is genuinely unknown — and that the raw module validates and executes without Binaryen repairing control flow.
//!
//! Emitted function names are `$func/<N>` ids — a module-wide monotonic index over every reachable function, prelude included — optionally suffixed with the source hint as `$func/<N>$hint`. The index carries identity; the hint is only origin annotation. Hot kernels are still located by a distinctive literal constant baked into their arithmetic (`65537` for LCG, `1000003` for trees) or by name-independent structure (self-recursion, the shared `$func/<N>`/`$clsr/<N>` index of a function used both directly and as a closure), never by a source name. A genuine irreducible-cycle dispatcher is the `loop $$dispatch/<anchor>` the emitter names in `into_wasm::expr_emitter`; an ordinary constructor-tag `switch` is not a dispatcher whatever shape it takes — a `br_table` over `$case$N`/`$tail` labels for three or more cases, a plain `if` for the two-way and one-way shapes.
